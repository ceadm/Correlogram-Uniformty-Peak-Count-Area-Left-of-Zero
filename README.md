# Correlogram-Uniformty-Peak-Count-Area-Left-of-Zero
This code quantifies firing dynamics from a recording of multiple neuronal signals by generating correlograms, then calculating correlogram uniformity, peak count, and area left of zero.  The script also generates figures to show how these metrics, and thereby relative signal timings and neuronal interactions, evolve through the recording.
